this is a program for one hand typing.

you only use the right hand to type

turn it on and press space to change to normal and half qwerty mode.
press enter to space.

i made it in .net8 so the portable version is too big so you should compile yourself
i also used NuGet thing called windows input simulator plus
you can see that in the usings.
